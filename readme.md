# Description

This is a personal learning project intended to both help me learn ThreeJS whilst automating the process for extruding my layered pixel art designs into 3D-printable models.

# Installing

`npm install`

# Running

I'm trying to set this up so that it runs on Github Pages. However, if you would like to run this locally on your machine, then run the following command after installing it.

`npm run dev`
